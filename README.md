# **Simulation of a DC Motor Speed Controller System using MATLAB**

This project is a simulation of a DC motor speed controller system using MATLAB, created by Bettina Dayrit, Gia Kyla Guevarra, Mariah Venice Rodriguez, and Keane Dwight Sulit, students of LBYEC3F â€“ EK1 (Feedback and Control Systems Laboratory) at the De La Salle University. The project was submitted to their instructor, Donabel de Veas Abuan, ECE, on April 11, 2023.

## **Overview**

The goal of this project is to simulate a DC motor speed controller system using MATLAB. The simulation will involve designing and implementing a controller that can regulate the speed of a DC motor. The system will be modeled using mathematical equations that describe the behavior of the motor, and a suitable controller will be designed to regulate the speed of the motor.

## **Files**

The following files are included in this project:

- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `3FFinalProjectCodes.mlx`: The MATLAB Live Script file containing the MATLAB code for the simulation.
- `step_responses.png`: A screenshot of the step responses of the system with and without the designed controllers.

## **Usage**

To run the simulation, open the `3FFinalProjectCodes.mlx` live script in MATLAB and run it. The script will initialize the simulation parameters, run the simulation, and plot the results. The `step_responses.png` file shows the comparison of the step responses of the system with and without the designed controllers.
